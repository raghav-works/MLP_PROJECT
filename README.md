ML Project on Predict the Success of Bank telemarketing

🚀 Boosting Bank Conversions with Machine Learning

 Excited to share my recent Machine Learning project:

 “Predicting Term Deposit Subscriptions Using Campaign Call Data” 📞📈

📌 Project Summary:

This project analyzes real-world telemarketing campaign data from a bank to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit. The dataset included 15+ features like age, job, education, loan status, contact duration, and past campaign outcomes.

🧠 Key Insights from EDA:

 🔹 Majority of customers (85%) did not subscribe — highly imbalanced dataset.

 🔹 Contact duration and number of calls had the strongest influence.
 
 🔹 Cellular contacts led to higher conversion rates than telephone.
 
 🔹 Campaign success was correlated with day/time and customer education.

📊 Tech Stack:
 
 • Python | Pandas | Scikit-learn | XGBoost | Matplotlib | Seaborn
 
 • Model performance was evaluated using F1 Score (macro) due to class imbalance.

✅ Outcome:
 
 • Built and compared multiple classifiers including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
 
 • Used SMOTE for handling imbalance and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
 
 • Achieved a strong F1-macro score with optimized XGBoost model.
